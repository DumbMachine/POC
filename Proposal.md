## About Me
I am Ratin Kumar, a 2nd-year undergraduate Computer Engineering student at National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra. I have good experience of using Python and Javascript for creating applications or just some hacky scripts to get things done. I really enjoy coding all the time, because of which I have numerous small projects on my Github.


Riding cycle, stalking stock trends and competitive FPS games are some of my interests outside of the world of programming.


### Open Source
I am part of many organizations on Github and have made multiple minor and a few major contributions. I love the spirit of Open Source, promoting universal access to code, and thus have become the part of this amazing community. Being a part of the Open Source group at my College, I have organized workshops on GIT and using Machine Learning for Image Captioning and continually help colleagues.


### Skills
* Good knowledge of using Python and some knowledge of the internals of Python.
* Knowledge of Data Science.
* Good background in Mathematics; Calculus and Linear Algebra.
* Comfortable with using GIT or any other similar service.

Project `redacted`**

## Abstract

The field of Artificial Intelligence is helping advancement of many fields. AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Some of the prominent examples range from `something `autonomous vehicles to life saving by helping in medical diagnosis. Apart from the aforementioned serious, AI is used in entertainment industry whether it maybe using AI to create articles or create deepfakes. The world has also seen AI being used to detect the wrongs in our society, like fake news and also to detect the wrongs by AI itself (eg deepfakes).

At the heart of most AI solutions lies requirement of **labeled data**. The lack of  labeled data makes impossible for the algorithm to learn the regularities and patterns in data. Labeling data, manually, is cumbersome and time consuming. AI solutions can be divided in two categories:

- Totally new
- Derivative of something 

Project `redacted` aims at providing a platform to simplify and speedup the process of data labeling by making use of automation tools and pre-trained machine learning models. This project will provide a simple gui to users for annotating data required by various machine learning tasks (computer vision based, nlp based or audio based) and make use of pre-trained models and some techniques (mentioned in implementation details section)  to allow automation of annotation to as far extent as possible. The gui will be supported by a `python` backend responsible for all preprocessing/recommendation for annotation and also storage of annotations received by the frontend.

## Background

CCExtractor, initially a small project, has now embedded itself firmly into large corporations and prestigious universities where it is used for many educational feats. This project will help fuel the fire of AI boom. It will introduce a tool to all the machine learning practitioners, which will allow them to annotate data a lot faster than before.

## Motivation

World of Artificial Intelligence has made big leaps in providing humans the power to find patterns in data. It will be the basis of most of the automation in the coming century, to keep this field expanding it requires data. Data, in its raw form, is available readily. This data accompanied with the right tool, which should focus on automatic and fast annotation, will improve efficiency of practitioners. Reduction of time spent annotating data implies increase in the time spent on finding solutions of real world problems.

## Project `redacted`

To accomplish this project's aims, a simple gui and a powerful backend which learns from past annotations are required. The gui will be simple and only expose those functions that are required and allow for usage of keyboard shortcuts to allow for reaching peak of efficiency of the manual annotators. The accompanying backend will actively learn from the annotations to suggest the annotations to users passively. This passive suggestion for manual annotators will mean no amount will be spend on annotation for correct suggestion and ignoring the suggestion, if wrong hence being a **passive suggestion**. Currently the benefits that will served from this project can be condensed to:

- Increase in speed and efficiency of manual annotators.
- Increase the amount of annotated data, as annotation tasks' difficulty and time investment decreases.
- Any more points?

`redacted` will allow institutes, professional or any interested party to annotate data fast and easily, leaving the party with more time for implementation of solution.

## Why do I want to Build `redacted`?

#### Why `redacted`?

Make the world more productive.

#### Why CCExtractor?

Mentor gave me the opportunity.



## Proposed Deliverables for GSOC

1. A simple react-based frontend, allowing for ingestion of the following:

   1. Computer-Vision based datasets for:

      - Image/Video Classification
      - Image Key points
      - Object Detection
      - Instance Segmentation
      - Action Recognition
      - Video Segmentation

   2. Natural-Language Processing based datasets for:

      - Classification

      - Named Entity Recognition

      - QnA

      - Machine Translation

      - Sentiment Analysis (sentiment slider)

      - Custom tasks ( like transliteration )

   3. Audio based datasets for:

      - Audio Transcription
      - Audio Segmentation
      - Audio Classification

2. A robust backend which will take care of:

   - Send data for annotation to frontend
   - Saving annotations received from frontend 
   - Export annotations to format allowing for ingestion from AutoML things, Detectron2 and Tensorflow Object Detection API and Our custom thing.
   - An active learning model, which will improve with each annotation and also provide suggestions for annotations.
   - Maintain metrics

3. Tests and Continuous Integration tools.

4. Detailed documentation; for users as well as developers.

5. Fortnightly blogs on developmental advances and milestones.

6. Setting the ground for a Model Zoo things, to allow ingestion of Annotations and train models. Possible integration with Rekognition.
